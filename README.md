- 👋 Hi, I’m @HughEvans01 and I'm a maker (and a software developer at IBM).
- 👀 I’m interested in making things: right now I mostly make computer software (and furniture from recycled materials) but I'm always looking for new skills to learn and opportunities to make things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Django.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything right now but plan to do some more game jams in future.
- :bust_in_silhouette: This is my personal GitHub account where I keep repositories with my game dev projects, practice projects, and some coursework from both my apprenticeship and my A-Level.
- 📫 You can reach me at hughevaans01@outlook.com
